This repo contains the code for the "Testing in Go" presentation, available at [ebonet.me/talks](ebonet.me/talks).

The talk was first given at The Developer Conference 2016, originally in Portuguese.


## Structure

The code is split in three branches:

1. `master`: Examples of tests using the standard library
2. `ginkgo`: Examples of tests using [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)
3. `goconvey`: Examples of tests using [goconvey](http://goconvey.co/)
